#### What?

Members, make sure you update your information in the ECOC membership directory. 

#### When?

As soon as possible. 

#### Where?

Please scan the QR codes found on the wall in the atrium OR come to the front desk after worship service

#### Why?

We are our brother's keepers! The only way that we can keep contact with one another is information on how to reach you (when you are ill, when we've missed you, or when we want to share events and opportunities with you). We also want to use the directory to collect information about business owners in our congregation so that we may support you and prioritize your business when taking care of our earthly matters.
